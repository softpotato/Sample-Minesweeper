# Sample-Minesweeper
This is a sample Minesweeper game generated for Discord. This is an unoriginal idea and just got inspired by a friend on discord who posted it. This also cuts down on the text, so you can have a max area of 222 characters. The only outside code that I sort of copied was from Stack Overflow on handling the catch statement for parsing non-integer inputs.
